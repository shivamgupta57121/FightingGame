Sample Input :

Attack Points of Monster : 5 <br>
Defence Points of Monster : 10 <br>
Damage of Monster : 3 <br>
Life Points of Monster : 40 <br>
Your Attack Points : 10 <br>
Your Defence Points : 5 <br>
Your Damage : 6 <br>
Your Life Points : 40 <br>

Output of Single Game Round :

Your attack <br>
Rolled Value : 6 <br>
Your attack value : 16 <br>
Your attack was successful. <br> 
Monster's remaining Life : 34 <br>

Explanation : By random function we have calculated turn , which comes out to be our. 
Then We have got sum of Two dice value as 6 that is also calculated using random numbers .
Now attack value comes out to be 16 i.e. 10(attack points) + 6(rolled value)
since monster defence points are less than our attack value , our attack is successful and monster life decreases by 6 since we can decrease monster life by damage of 6 points.
